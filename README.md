# Automated Purchase Script

Hi there! Thank you for reviewing my script!

## **Overview**

This script automates the process of purchasing a product from the Magento e-commerce platform. It navigates through the website, selects a product based on specific criteria, adds it to the cart, and completes the purchase.


### **Features**
Automatic Dependency Installation: The script checks for required packages and installs them if not present
Product Selection: Navigates to the 'Men' category, selects the 'Tees' sub-category, and applies a 'Black' color filter
Product Configuration: Chooses a random quantity (between 1 to 9) for the selected product
Checkout Process: Adds the product to the cart, enters user details, and completes the purchase
Purchase Verification: Asserts the success of the purchase and prints a success message


### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Chrome Browser

### Dependencies (Line 8 -17 should install if not already)
- selenium 
- webdriver_manager

### Future Improvements :)

- Replace brittle XPath usages 
- Add error handling for unexpected website changes
- Add upport for other browsers
